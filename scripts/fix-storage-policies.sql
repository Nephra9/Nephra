-- Fix storage RLS policies for avatar uploads
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, ensure the avatars bucket exists and is public
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = true;

-- Drop existing policies on storage.objects for avatars
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatars" ON storage.objects;

-- Create new, simpler storage policies for avatars
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatars" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatars" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Alternative: If the above doesn't work, try this more permissive policy
-- (Remove the above policies first if you use this)
